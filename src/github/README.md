# GitHub MCP Server

The GitHub MCP Server is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)
server that provides seamless integration with GitHub APIs, enabling advanced
automation and interaction capabilities for developers and tools.

## Use Cases

- Automating GitHub workflows and processes.
- Extracting and analyzing data from GitHub repositories.
- Building AI powered tools and applications that interact with GitHub's ecosystem.

## Prerequisites

1. To run the server in a container, you will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
2. Once Docker is installed, you will also need to ensure Docker is running.
3. Lastly you will need to [Create a GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).
The MCP server can use many of the GitHub APIs, so enable the permissions that you feel comfortable granting your AI tools (to learn more about access tokens, please check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)).

## Installation

### Usage with VS Code

For quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons at the top of this README. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start.

For manual installation, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.

Optionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.

> Note that the `mcp` key is not needed in the `.vscode/mcp.json` file.

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "github_token",
        "description": "GitHub Personal Access Token",
        "password": true
      }
    ],
    "servers": {
      "github": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "-e",
          "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
          "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
        ],
        "env": {
          "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:github_token}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

More about using MCP server tools in VS Code's [agent mode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).

### Usage with Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Build from source

If you don't have Docker, you can use `go build` to build the binary in the
`cmd/github-mcp-server` directory, and use the `github-mcp-server stdio` command with the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable set to your token. To specify the output location of the build, use the `-o` flag. You should configure your server to use the built executable as its `command`. For example:

```JSON
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "github": {
        "command": "/path/to/github-mcp-server",
        "args": ["stdio"],
        "env": {
          "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Tool Configuration

The GitHub MCP Server supports enabling or disabling specific groups of functionalities via the `--toolsets` flag. This allows you to control which GitHub API capabilities are available to your AI tools. Enabling only the toolsets that you need can help the LLM with tool choice and reduce the context size.

### Available Toolsets

The following sets of tools are available (all are on by default):

| Toolset                 | Description                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `repos`                 | Repository-related tools (file operations, branches, commits) |
| `issues`                | Issue-related tools (create, read, update, comment)           |
| `users`                 | Anything relating to GitHub Users                             |
| `pull_requests`         | Pull request operations (create, merge, review)               |
| `code_security`         | Code scanning alerts and security features                    |
| `experiments`           | Experimental features (not considered stable)                 |

#### Specifying Toolsets

To specify toolsets you want available to the LLM, you can pass an allow-list in two ways:

1. **Using Command Line Argument**:

   ```bash
   github-mcp-server --toolsets repos,issues,pull_requests,code_security
   ```

2. **Using Environment Variable**:
   ```bash
   GITHUB_TOOLSETS="repos,issues,pull_requests,code_security" ./github-mcp-server
   ```

The environment variable `GITHUB_TOOLSETS` takes precedence over the command line argument if both are provided.

### Using Toolsets With Docker

When using Docker, you can pass the toolsets as environment variables:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \
  -e GITHUB_TOOLSETS="repos,issues,pull_requests,code_security,experiments" \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

### The "all" Toolset

The special toolset `all` can be provided to enable all available toolsets regardless of any other configuration:

```bash
./github-mcp-server --toolsets all
```

Or using the environment variable:

```bash
GITHUB_TOOLSETS="all" ./github-mcp-server
```

## Dynamic Tool Discovery

**Note**: This feature is currently in beta and may not be available in all environments. Please test it out and let us know if you encounter any issues.

Instead of starting with all tools enabled, you can turn on dynamic toolset discovery. Dynamic toolsets allow the MCP host to list and enable toolsets in response to a user prompt. This should help to avoid situations where the model gets confused by the shear number of tools available.

### Using Dynamic Tool Discovery

When using the binary, you can pass the `--dynamic-toolsets` flag.

```bash
./github-mcp-server --dynamic-toolsets
```

When using Docker, you can pass the toolsets as environment variables:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \
  -e GITHUB_DYNAMIC_TOOLSETS=1 \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

## GitHub Enterprise Server

The flag `--gh-host` and the environment variable `GITHUB_HOST` can be used to set
the GitHub Enterprise Server hostname.

## i18n / Overriding Descriptions

The descriptions of the tools can be overridden by creating a
`github-mcp-server-config.json` file in the same directory as the binary.

The file should contain a JSON object with the tool names as keys and the new
descriptions as values. For example:

```json
{
  "TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION": "an alternative description",
  "TOOL_CREATE_BRANCH_DESCRIPTION": "Create a new branch in a GitHub repository"
}
```

You can create an export of the current translations by running the binary with
the `--export-translations` flag.

This flag will preserve any translations/overrides you have made, while adding
any new translations that have been added to the binary since the last time you
exported.

```sh
./github-mcp-server --export-translations
cat github-mcp-server-config.json
```

You can also use ENV vars to override the descriptions. The environment
variable names are the same as the keys in the JSON file, prefixed with
`GITHUB_MCP_` and all uppercase.

For example, to override the `TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION` tool, you can
set the following environment variable:

```sh
export GITHUB_MCP_TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION="an alternative description"
```
